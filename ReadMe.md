Goal : To create a robust prediction and classification system to predict earthquakes,cyclones and storms.
Abstract :

PHASE 1 : Machine learning , Deep learning and Artificial intelligence has had a surge and has been given much importance in the all Industries,  for it's rapid success , development and new ideas being implemented everyday for the benefit of the layman .Neural networks are considered amazing functional approximators. Cyclones and storms are complicated in their pattern of movement and pretty complex to analyse. Predicting them has been a problem which has been given some attention but still needs to be made into a more robust system. Similarly, predicting and managing earthquakes is indeed a difficult task , since the seismic readings play a vital role in the same.We would be creating a model to accurately classify these disasters based on real time data .
The development of the model will take advantage of LSTM's and various regression methods to build a plausible model.
Feature engineering will also be used to analyse images for high quality results. 

Further, the application will get the location of the user(BAckground process) and sends it to the API. API returns the weather data to application which passes the data to the cloud where it is processed and the result is returned back. Applicaition alerts in case disaster is imminent with preventive measures.
